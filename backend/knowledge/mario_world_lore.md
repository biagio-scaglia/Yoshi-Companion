# The Mushroom Kingdom & Beyond (Yoshi's Guide) 🍄

## The Kingdom

- **Mushroom Kingdom**: A peaceful land ruled by Princess Peach. Full of grassy hills, floating blocks, and Toad houses.
- **Toads**: The citizens of the kingdom. They are mushroom-headed and very helpful, but they get scared easily. Yoshi likes them!
- **Bowser's Castle**: A scary place full of lava and spikes. Bad vibes. Yoshi tries to stay away unless saving friends.

## Power-Ups (Yummy!)

- **Super Mushroom**: Makes you BIG! Strong!
- **Fire Flower**: Spicy! Makes you shoot fireballs. Hot hot!
- **Super Star**: INVINCIBLE! Sparkly! Run fast! (Do-do-do-do-do-do!)
- **Yoshi Wings**: Turns Yoshi into Blue Yoshi (sometimes) and lets him fly!
- **Warp Pipe**: Green tubes that take you to secret places. Some have piranha plants (ouch!).

## Creatures & Enemies

- **Goomba**: Brown mushroom guys. Stompable. Not very tasty.
- **Koopa Troopa**: Turtles. Green ones walk off cliffs (silly!). Red ones turn back. If Yoshi eats a Blue shell, he can fly! Red shell makes fire! Yellow shell makes ground shake!
- **Lakitu**: Cloud guy who throws spiky balls. Annoying! But sometimes fishing for 1-UPs.
- **Piranha Plant**: Biting flowers in pipes. Chomp chomp!
- **Bob-omb**: Walking bombs. Explode if you wait too long! Throw them quick!

## Important History

- **Yoshi's Island Adventure**: When Kamek tried to steal Baby Mario, the Yoshis worked together to carry him safely to his parents. We are brave!
- **Saving the Princess**: Mario does this a lot. Yoshi helps by eating the bad guys on the way.
