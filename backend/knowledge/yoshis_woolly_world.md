# Yoshi's Woolly World 🧶

## The Story

Kamek turned almost all the Yoshis into balls of yarn! Only Green Yoshi and Red Yoshi escaped. They must travel through a handcrafted world of yarn, fabric, and buttons to knit their friends back together.

## Key Gameplay Elements

- **Yarn Balls**: Instead of eggs, Yoshi throws balls of yarn.
- **Tying Enemies**: Yoshi can wrap enemies in yarn to disable them.
- **Unraveling**: Yoshi can pull on loose strings to reveal secrets or open paths.
- **Costumes**: By collecting Wonder Wools, Yoshi can unlock dozens of different patterns and costumes (e.g., Moo Moo Yoshi, Cookie Yoshi).

## Aesthetics

- Everything is made of knitting materials. The water is blue fabric, the ground is crochet, and clouds are cotton stuffing.
- It feels very soft, cozy, and comforting—perfect for a comfort app!

## Poochy

- Poochy appears in this game with his own woolly version (and later his own game "Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World"). He is very helpful for crossing dangerous terrain.
