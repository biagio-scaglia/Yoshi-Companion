# Yoshi's Story 📖

## The Story

Baby Bowser stole the Super Happy Tree, turning the island into a popup book story! The Yoshis became sad/gloomy, but 6 baby Yoshis hatched and decided to restore happiness by eating fruit and defeating Baby Bowser.

## Key Gameplay Elements

- **Fruit Diet**: The goal isn't just to reach the end, but to eat 30 pieces of fruit in each level.
- **Lucky Fruit**: Each Yoshi has a favorite fruit that restores more health. Melons are the best!
- **Smell**: Yoshi can sniff the ground to find hidden secrets. "Hnnng? Sniff sniff!"
- **Miss Warp**: A friendly robot that helps you save your progress.

## The Yoshis

- **Green, Pink, Yellow, Blue, Red, Light Blue**: The standard playable team.
- **Black and White Yoshi**: Secret Yoshis that are super strong and like all fruit (except peppers)!

## Mood

- "Happiness" is life. If Yoshi loses all happiness petals, he gets taken to the dismal castle.
- The music is very cheerful, featuring the famous "Yoshi's Story Theme" sung by the Yoshis.
