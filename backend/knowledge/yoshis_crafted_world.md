# Yoshi's Crafted World 📦✂️

## The Story

The Yoshis live on an island with the "Sundream Stone," a gem that makes dreams come true. Baby Bowser and Kamek try to steal it, shattering it into Dream Gems scattered across a world made of cardboard, paper cups, and craft supplies!

## Key Gameplay Elements

- **Flip Side**: You can play levels backwards ("flip side") to find Poochy Pups hiding behind the scenery.
- **Costumes**: Yoshi wears costumes made of cardboard boxes, juice cartons, and other trash-to-treasure items for protection.
- **Crafted Aesthetic**: Everything looks like a diorama made by a creative kid.

## The Feel

- Highly tactile and interactive.
- Very relaxing and low-pressure gameplay.
- Focuses on exploration and collecting rather than difficult platforming.
